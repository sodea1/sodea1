## About Me  
I'm a software engineer specializing in frontend and full-stack development. I'm passionate about building user-friendly, scalable web applications and enjoy working on projects that enhance user experience and solve real-world problems.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Flouis.net
As I began learning French using apps like Duolingo I felt disengaged doing endless, repetitive fill in the blank and word matching exercises. I wanted to practice French the way language is meant to be used -- through spontaneous, free-flowing conversation.

Flouis.net is exactly that: an **AI-powered language learning platform** designed for conversation-based learning. Unlike traditional apps that focus on structured drills, Flouis.net allows users to **learn through natural conversation**, leveraging AI to provide **real-time grammar corrections, speech-to-text, and instant translations**.
